This repository contains several Antora playbooks for building developer resources at:

- https://neo4j.com/developer/
- https://neo4j.com/labs/
- https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/
- https://neo4j.com/graphgists/

== Installation

In order to build the content,

[source,sh]
npm i

The npm install command will install link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/cli/[Antora CLI^], which is then used to build the content defined in the Antora Playbooks (`*.yml` files in the project root).

== Build

To build the content, run the build command:

[source,sh]
npm run build

== Preview

You can run a local server to preview the built content by running:

[source,sh]
npm start

This will launch a server at http://localhost:8000/

== Publishing

Any changes to the `master` branch will trigger an automatic rebuild of _all content_ using Github Actions.
The action runs the `npm run build` command which builds the following playbooks using the Antora CLI:

- `unversioned.yml` - Developer guides at `neo4j.com/developer/*` and Labs pages at `neo4j.com/labs/*`
- `labs-docs.yml` - Builds the documentation from remote sources into `neo4j.com/labs/{project}/{version}`
  - link:https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/5/[APOC^]
  - link:https://neo4j.com/labs/neosemantics/4.0/[Neosemantics^]
  - link:https://neo4j.com/labs/kafka/4.0/[Neo4j Streams/Kafka^]
  - link:https://neo4j.com/labs/etl-tool/1.5.0/[ETL Tool^]
  - link:https://neo4j.com/labs/neodash/2.4/[NeoDash^]
  - link:https://neo4j.com/labs/neo4j-needle-starterkit/2.0/[Needle Starter Kit^]
  - link:https://neo4j.com/labs/rdflib-neo4j/1.0/[RDFlib-Neo4j^]
  - link:https://neo4j.com/labs/aura-cli/1.0/[Aura CLI^]

The HTML files built by the build command are uploaded to the `static-content.neo4j.com` S3 Bucket, where it is synced hourly with the link:neo4j.com[] server.  The cronjob runs on the hour, every hour so it may take up to an hour for the content to become live.

NOTE: In addition, we are using Netlify to deploy a preview of the site at: https://docs-neo4j.netlify.app/

== Theme Specifics

For more information on specific theme features, clone the link:https://github.com/neo4j-documentation/documentation-starter[Documentation Starter] and run `npm start`.


== Migrating from the old Developer Guides

=== Variables, Attributes, etc

Instead of defining variables in a text file (think `versions.txt`), these are now defined under `asciidoc` and `attributes` in either the playbook (eg `developer.yml`) or inside `antora.yml` in the content repo.

.developer.yml playbook
[source,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    page-theme: developer
    page-cdn: /static/assets
----

.antora.yml in content repo
[source,yaml]
----
asciidoc:
  attributes:
    img: https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/
    theme: developer
    neo4j-ogm-version: 3.1.6
    spring-data-neo4j-version: 5.1.3.RELEASE
    neo4j-stable-version: 4.0.3
    bolt-driver-version: 1.7.0
    java-driver-version: 4.0.1
----

=== Page Level

[source,adoc]
----
:level: Beginner
[role=expertise]
{level}
----

Becomes:

[source,adoc]
----
:level: Beginner
[role=expertise {level}]
{level}
